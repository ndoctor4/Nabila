## HIV prevalence from WHO

* We used a tidy version of the HIV prevalence data in lab 2, and
saw the raw version in lab 3. In this lab we will tidy the latter into the former.

```{r,message=TRUE}
hiv <- read_csv("HIVprevRaw.csv")
```

(The columns for 1988 and 1989 are completely empty and 
were read in as logical. We will be removing these and so won't
worry about over-riding the logical with double.)

```{r}
hiv
```


1. The first column of the data frame is the country, but it
has been named`Estimated HIVPrevalence% - (Ages 15 49 1)`.
Use the `rename()` function to rename this column  `Country`.
(Hint: The current variable name contains special characters
and will need to be enclosed in quotes.)

```{r}
hiv <- hiv %>% rename(Country='Estimated HIV Prevalence% - (Ages 15-49)')
```

2. The data from 1979 to 1989 is very sparse. Remove these
columns from the data frame.

```{r}
hiv <- hiv %>% select(Country,'1990':'2011')
```

3. Gather the yearly prevalence estimates into key, value pairs
with `year` as the key and `prevalence` as the value. When
you gather, remove explicity missing values. After gathering,
sort on "Country". 

```{r}
hiv <- hiv %>% gather('1990':'2011',key=year,value=prevalence,na.rm=TRUE) %>% arrange(Country)
hiv
```
